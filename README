# 🎗️ Mammogram AI Detection

An end-to-end Deep Learning project for detecting breast tumors (Benign / Malignant / Normal) in ultrasound images.
The system uses a fine-tuned **ResNet50** model, served via a **FastAPI** backend, and accessible through a user-friendly **Streamlit** dashboard.

## Model Performance
We utilized **Transfer Learning** with the **ResNet50** architecture (pretrained on ImageNet) and fine-tuned it on breast ultrasound data.

- **Architecture:** ResNet50
- **Accuracy:** ~84% on the test set
- **Classes:** Normal, Benign, Malignant
- **Techniques:** Data Augmentation, Normalization, Softmax Probability Distribution.


## How to Run the Project

To run the full system, you need to launch both the **Backend Server** and the **Frontend UI** simultaneously (in separate terminals).

```bash
python api/server.py

```bash
streamlit run frontend/app.py
